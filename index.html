        Build a periodic expression module of Cas9
    </p>
    <p>
        To verify that our design enables Cas9 to be expressed periodically, we built a module for the periodic
        expression of Cas9, and the experiments were carried out as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Construct the recombinant plasmid pRH003-URA3-CLB2 promoter-Cas9 by in-fusion cloning. Then transform it
        into E. coli DH5Î±. Extract plasmids from transformants. The recombinant plasmids were confirmed by colony
        PCR and sequencing, then transformed into S. cerevisiae BY4741. Screen for transformants by SD-ura culture
        medium.
    </p>
    <p>
        2.Synchronize the cell cycle of S. cerevisiae population to G1 phase.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.Release yeast cells from synchronization. Remove a time-zero fraction. Collect fractions of culture every
        10 min for 150 min. Extract total protein for Western Blot. Strain without being transformed was used as a
        negative control. GAPDH was chosen as an internal reference.
